In the labs we developped a compiler for Amy, which is a simple functionnal programming language. In Amy, the most interesting language feature is the use of abstract data types (ADT). We define types and then use pattern matching to manipulate them. One of the most commonly used ADT is List. 

As Amy is a typed language, ADT are defined for a specific type. For example List is defined for elements of type Int in the Amy standard library. If we want to use a list of String and use all functions defined on List, we have to define all types and functions again. This is very slow and is prone to error as we have to copy some code. To solve this problem, we will introduce polymorphic types. Polymorphic types are types that are defined for one abstract class, case class or function. We define one type or function using one or more polymorphic types. Then we can use this function or class with any types, as long as the usage is coherent with the definition.
